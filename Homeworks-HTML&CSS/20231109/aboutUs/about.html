        <h2><i><b>Our History</b></i></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Founded in 1932 by baker Pierre Poilâne, Poilâne® has stood the test of time by preserving the best of the best. 3 generations, Pierre, Lionel, Apollonia have succeeded each other with the same exigence, to offer handmade breads,  sablés  and bakers pastries baked in wood-fired ovens. These are authentic, nourishing, and nutritious baked goods with a unique taste.</p>
        <img src="../images/history.webp" alt="The begining" title="Pierre Poilâne and his daughter" width="350">
        <p>Located at 8 Rue du Cherche-Midi in the 6th  arrondissement  of Paris, the original Poilâne ® bakery, created in 1932, is the nerve center of the internationally renowned company.

        <h2><i><b>Our Products</b></i></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Made from ingredients selected for their quality, both in terms of respect for the environment but also for their taste and nutritional values, Poilâne® products remain faithful to baking traditions while also meeting Poilâne®’s standards for their composition and environmental impact. 
        Convinced that the quality of a product is intrinsically dependent on the savoir-faire of the baker who makes it, Poilâne® baked goods are made by hand by our compagnons-boulangers who train for a minimum of nine months with an experienced master baker who is committed to transmitting the  savoir-faire necessary to accomplish their job. Learning the gestures, an understanding of the fermentation process and how to work the dough, the baking with wood fired oven, using all 5 senses as the best tools are amongst of the broad themes which comprise this training.</p>
