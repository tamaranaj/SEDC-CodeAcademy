  <h6>Certificate of Authenticity</h6>
  <br />
  <p>
    A certificate of authenticity (COA) is a document from an authoritative
    source that verifies the artworkâ€™s authenticity. While many COAs are signed
    by the artist, others will be signed by the representing gallery or the
    printmaker who collaborated with the artist on the work. For secondary
    market works, authorized estates or foundations are often the issuing party.
  </p>

  <p>
    COAs typically include the name of the artist, the details (date,
    description, category of art) of the work in question, and whenever possible
    an image of the work.
